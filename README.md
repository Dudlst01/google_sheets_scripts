# google_sheets_script

The purpose of this script was to solve a problem that my previous company had where they needed to create a new sheet in Google Sheets when a new employee submitted a Reimbursement response via Google Forms.
I wrote this function in Google AppsScript that creates a new sheet in Google Sheets when a new respondent submits a response and added to a current employee's sheet when they submit a response.
